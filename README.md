Hi, I’m @RMSabe
I’m interested in development for desktop and embedded systems. I like developing user and kernel applications for GNU Linux Kernel.
I also do some basic Windows MINGW64 applications, using the Win32 format.
And I also like to code for MCUs.
Most of what I make is in C/C++.
I'm merely a hobbyist. Projects I post here are made "Just for fun". Don't expect professional performance from them.
