Hi, I’m @RMSabe
I’m interested in development for desktop and embedded systems. I like developing user and kernel applications for GNU Linux Systems.
I also develop some basic Windows Win32 applications, using the MinGW64 resources.
And I also like to code for MCUs.
Most of what I make is in C/C++, and mostly procedural programming (even in C++).
I'm merely a hobbyist. Projects I post here are made "Just for fun". Don't expect professional performance from them.
